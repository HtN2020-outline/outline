# Outline
Outline is a Chrome extension for university students to efficiently and effectively parse through PDF course outlines for important deadlines and dates. It then compacts this information into a downloadable .ics file which can then be imported into a calendar, automatically populating oneâ€™s calendar with all the crucial dates from the course.

## How Outline Works

* Open the easily accessible Chrome extension.
* Upload your course outline.
* OUTLINE parses the PDF for deadlines and important dates.
* The .ics file is downloaded and imported to your calendar.
